# Barrel File
  A barrel file in programming is a way to organize and simplify imports in a project by creating a single file that re-exports content (like functions, classes, constants, etc.) from multiple files.
  
  ðŸ”š Bottom line:
        barrel.dart always should be in the same folder where the exported files live. That keeps structure clean and logical.

# ðŸ”¹ components Folder:
